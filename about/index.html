      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>Growing up, I was often surrounded by people who love the art of photography. They, especially my dad and
        grandpa, taught me how to find beauty and balance in the smallest details of a setting, and how to turn that
        beauty into a photograph that could be preserved. As I have grown up, I gained a love for two types of
        photography
        in particular: portrait and black & white photography.</p>

      <h3>Portrait and B&W Photography</h3>
      <p>Although they exist as two fairly different facets of photography, one being a genre and the other being a
        style,
        portrait and black and white photography have held my attention for most of my photography career. I love to
        work
        with both movement and light in my shoots. Photographing people and animals provides the natural movement needed
        for a candid, grounded photo. Working in contrasting styles like black and white forces you to focus on the
        lighting of your surroundings and think about how you can best use it to produce beauty even from a seemingly
        plain and boring canvas.</p>
